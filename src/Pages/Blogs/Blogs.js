                        The authorization is a process utilized in an app that helps in controlling the informational access and limiting actions performed by users. Similarly, authentication is a process to check if the user is allowed to access the information or perform any action. If an authenticated user is using your app, they have identified their true identity through several ways, such as providing the right credentials.

                        Although authentication will help you know the true identity of a user, it canâ€™t help you control access, which is why we utilize authorization with authentication. Without one of these two, havoc can be created in your app. For instance, any user can change the password of another or delete data posted by another user

                        Firebase gives a quick database and a backend for web apps that need to be built and scaled fast.

                        Connecting a Firebase database to a React app is, unfortunately, not straightforward. There are some confusing things about the way data sync in Firebase integrates with how React handles state. To get the most out of Firebase, it's best to integrate it in a manner that complements the uni-directional data flow pattern of React
